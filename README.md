Numbas editor Vagrant script
==============

A Vagrant script to set up an instance of the Numbas editor, to do development on.

You'll need [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), which runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

Run either `bootstrap.sh` or `bootstrap.bat`, depending on your platform. These just clone the Numbas compiler and editor into folders called `numbas` and `editor`, respectively, then turn on the vagrant instance.

Once it's all set up, you can access the editor at http://localhost:4567.
